**Introduction to Genome-Wide Association Studies**

We are delighted to come together with you to host another online workshop : Introduction to Genome-Wide Association Studies.

▶️ Invited speaker : Dr. Tatiana Tatarinova

▶️ About Dr. Tatiana Tatarinova :

Dr. Tatiana is an Associate Professor, Biology & Fletcher Jones Endowed Chair In Computational Biology. Dr. Tatiana's first degree was in Theoretical Physics, followed by the MS and PhD in Applied Mathematics. She worked at the Ceres inc, as a computational scientist, and then left the industry for an academic career. Dr. Tatiana's focus is development of algorithms for data analysis.

Genome-wide association studies have become increasingly popular to identify associations between genotypic and phenotypic traits. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) screen the genome for associations between millions of genetic variants and a disease or trait without any a priori hypothesis. As such, GWASs may reveal new genes and pathways not previously implicated in the disease pathology. During this workshop, a mix of hands‐on experience and theoretical background will be presented and the participants will walk through a series of data manipulation and visualization exercises.
